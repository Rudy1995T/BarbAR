# BarbAR
BarbAR is an augmented reality based application designed to help apprentice barbers to learn how to cut hair. Using Microsoftâ€™s HoloLens, the app allows an apprentice to view tracing lines on their customers hair as a guide to cut. The AR app talks with an Android app that will allow apprentices to start haircuts and for their mentor to view their progress.
